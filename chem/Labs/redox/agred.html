<h1>The Reduction of Silver</h1>

The half reaction for the reduction of silver is<p>

<center>
Ag<sup>+</sup> + e<sup>-</sup> --> Ag
</center>

Note that in the reduction of silver, as in any reduction process, electrons
are used up.  Thus, electrons always appear on the reactant side of a
reduction half reaction.  The number of electrons usedd in the reduction
half reaction must be come from the oxidation half reaction.  This
will be valuable to know when trying to balance oxidation/reduction reaction
equations.<p>

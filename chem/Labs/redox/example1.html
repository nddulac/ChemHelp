<h1>Example: Formation of Sodium Chloride</h1>

Consider the reaction<p>

<center>2 Na + Cl<sub>2</sub> --> 2 NaCl</center><p>

We know that sodium chloride is an ionic species.  When sodium chloride 
dissolves in water, it dissociates to form sodium ions with their positive 
charge and chloride ions with their negative charge.  
<a href="ex1mltmd.html">A simple conductivity experiment demonstrates 
this.</a><p>

<a name="forces">
Like all ionic species, the force which holds sodium chloride together in a 
crystals is an electrical attractive force.  The positive charge on the 
sodium ion is attracted to the negative charge on the chloride ion.  The 
relative charges on the ions determine the formula of a single 
<a href="gloss.html#formula_unit">formula unit</a> of the ionic species.<p>

<a name"Na">
<b>What is happening to the sodium atoms?</b><br>
A sodium atom will ionize bye giving up an electron.  In so doing, the 
atom has ten remaining electrons - the same number as the nearest neighbor 
noble gas atom, neon.  Since sodium has eleven protons in its nucleus, the 
resultant ion has a positive charge.  The change can be represented by the 
following chemical reaction equation:<p>

<center>Na --> Na<sup>+</sup> + e<sup>-</sup></center><p>

The <a href="gloss.html#oxidation_number">oxidation number</a> on sodium 
increases from 0 to +1 and so we call this process of sodium giving up an 
electron <b>oxidation</b>.  In fact, any oxidation process involves the loss 
of one or more electrons.<p>

<a name="Cl">
<b>What is happening to the chlorine atoms?</b><br>
A chlorine atom will ionize by gaining an electron.  In so doing, the atom 
will have eighteen electrons - the same number is the nearest neighbor 
noble gas atom, argon.  Since a chlorine atom has only seventeen protons in 
its nucleus, the resulting ion will have a charge of -1.  The change for 
chlorine can be represented by the following chemical reaction:<p>

<center>Cl<sub>2</sub> + 2 e<sup>-</sup> --> 2 Cl<sup>-</sup></center><p>

The <a href="gloss.html#oxidation_number">oxidation number</a> on chlorine 
decreases from 0 to -1.  This is an example of 
<a href="gloss.html#reduction">reduction</a>.  Since the source of the 
elctrons needed for the reduction of chlorine is the sodium, it is clear that 
both oxidation and reduction are taking place in this reaction.<p>

All electrons which are used in the reduction of chlorine must come from 
the oxidation of sodium.  It is clear, therefore, that two sodium atoms must 
oxidize for every chlorine molecule that is reduced.<p>

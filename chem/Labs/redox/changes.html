<h1>Electron exchange reactions</h1>

Many reactions involve the <a href="example1.html">exchange of electrons</a>. 
We know, for example, that when a neutral metal atom loses an 
<a href="gloss.html#electron">electron</a>, the atom forms a positve 
<a href="gloss.html#ion">ion</a>.  The <a href="charges.html">charge</a> on 
the atom changes from zero to +1.  At the same time, an electron is freed to 
interact with another atom or molecule.<p>

Another example of a chemical change which involves an exchange of electrons 
is the formation of an <a href="gloss.html#anion">anion</a> from a neutral 
nonmetal atom.  This occurs by the atom collecting an electron.  The 
resulting ion will have a negative charge.  The electron which is collected 
by the nonmetal atom must come from someplace.<p>For this reason, a change 
which involves an atom or molecule giving up an electron (or more than one 
elctron) is always accompanied by a change which involves an atom or molecule 
gaining an electron (or more than one elctron). These processes always occur 
in pairs.<p>

This module will discuss how we as chemists describe chemical changes which 
involve an exchange of electrons.<p>

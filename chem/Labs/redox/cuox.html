<h1>The Oxidation of Copper</h1>

The half reaction for the oxidation of copper is<p>

<center>
Cu --> Cu<sup>+2</sup> + 2 e<sup>-</sup>
</center>

Note that in the oxidation of copper, as in any oxidation process, electrons
are given off.  Thus, electrons always appear on the product side of an
oxidation half reaction.  The number of electrons freed in the oxidation
half reaction must be used completely by the reduction half reaction.  This
will be valuable to know when trying to balance oxidation/reduction reaction
equations.<p>

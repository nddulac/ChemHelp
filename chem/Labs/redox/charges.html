<h1>Comments on the Charges of Ions</h1>
Keep in mind that the charge on an ion has to do with the numbers of 
<a href="gloss.html#electron">electrons</a> and 
<a href="gloss.html#proton">protons</a>.<p>

Consider a sodium atom.  A sodium atom has 11 protons, 12 neutrons and 11
electrons.  Because the number of electrons and protons are equal, the 
electrical charge due to the protons (+11) is exactly cancelled by that 
due to the electrons (-11).  If the atom loses an electron, the electrical
charge due to the protons (+11) will no longer be cancelled by that of the 
electrons (-10) and the resulting ion will have a charge of +1.<p>

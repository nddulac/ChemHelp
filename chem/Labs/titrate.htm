In this simulation, you will have the chance to review the procedure for stanardizing a solution of NaOH (precisely determining its concentration) by titration with potassium hydrogen phthalate (KHP).<p>
For an actual standardization of NaOH solution with KHP as the promary standard, you will require the following equipment and materials:<p>

<div name="chemicals">
  <img src="/~pfleming/chem/titrate/chemicals.jpg" align="right" height="300" width="500">
</div>

Chemicals:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Sodium hydroxide (solid)
  <li>Potassium hydrogen phthalate (solid)
  <li>deionized water (liquid, oddly enough)
  <li>phenolphthalein indicator solution
</ol>
Glassware:<br>
<ol>
  <li>buret (50 mL)
  <li>Elenmeyer flask (125 or 250 mL)
  <li>magnetic stirer (optional)
  <li>droppers and stirring rods (as needed)
</ol>
</div>

<div name="intro">
<h3>First, a little review.</h3>
The process of <u>standardization</u> is the process of determining the precise value of a measured quantity by comparison to a <u>primary standard</u>. In this case, we wish
to determine the concentration of a sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution so that we can use the solution in titratations where precision is required. After the standardization,
The NaOH solution will be a <u>secondary standard</u>. We will use potassium hydrogen phthalate (KHP) as a <u>primary standard</u>. KHP is well-suited for this purprose for
a very important reasons: KHP is not very hygroscopic, so it doesn't absorb water from the atmosphere. As such, the mass of KHP measured on a balance can be used to determine 
exactly how many moles of KHP are bing used.<p>
</div>

<div name="procedure">
<h3>Procedure</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Obtain enough NaOH to make approximately 500 mL of 0.2 M NaOH solution. The mass need only be approximate.
  <li>Dissolve the NaOH in enough deionized water to make roughly 500 mL of solution. The volume need only be approximate.
  <li>Obtain enough KHP so that you will use roughly 20 mL of your NaOH solution (which shoudl have a concentration of 
      approximately 0.2 M.) The mass should be known as precisely as possible (typically to +/- 0.0001 g)
  <li>Dissolve the KHP in a small voume of deionized water and add about three drops of phenolphthalein.
  <li>Titrate the KHP to the endpoint. Do this carefully as you approach the endpoint so as to get an 
      accurate determination of the actual endpoint!
  <li>Repeat the titration two or three more times to get a precise dtermination of the concentration of the NaOH solution concentration.
</ol>

When you do the standardization titration, you would liek to use a significant enough volume of the titrant 
so that a small error in a volume rading is only a small fraction of the total value delevered. Let's suppose 
we are using a 50 mL buret to deliver the NaOH solution. A significant volume might be considered to be about 20 mL. 
(Less than 10 mL will give us only three significant figures in the volume, for example.) So let's assume we want to 
use approximately 20 mL of NaOH solution (which we have made to be approximately 0.2 M.)

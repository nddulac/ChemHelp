<a name="A"><h3>A</h3>
<a name="anion"><b><u>Anion</u></b> - an ion with a negative charge.

<a name="C"><h3>C</h3>
<a name="cation"><b><u>Cation</u></b> - an ion with a positive charge.

<a name="E"><h3>E</h3>
<a name="electron"><b><u>Electron</u></b> - one of the three basic sub-atomic 
particles.  An electron has a mass aproximately 1/1800th that of a proton
(9.109 534 5 x 10-31 kg.)  An electron also carries a negative electrical 
charge (1.602 189 2 x 10^-19 C.)  Because the charge on the electron and
that on the proton are equal in magnitude (althoug opposite in sign), the
charge on a single elctron is oftentimes referenced in terms of a relative
charge.  The relative charge on an electron is -1.<p>

<a name="F"><h3>F</h3>
<a name="formula_unit"><b><u>Formula Unit</u></b> - the simplest ratio of
<a href="#ion">ions</a> in an <a href="#ionic_compound">ionic compound</a>.  
A formula unit of barrium chloride contains two chloride ions and one barrium 
ion.  The formula for barrium chloride is BaCl_2.<p>

<a name="I"><h3>I</h3>
<a name="ion"><b><u>Ion</u></b> - a charged atom or molecule.  A monatomic 
ion does not have equal numbers of electrons and protons.  If the number of 
electrons is less than the number of protons, the ion will have a net 
positive charge.  Positively charged ions are called <a href="#cation">
cations</a>.  An ion in which the number of electrons eceeds the number of 
protons has a negative charge.  Negatively charged ions are called 
<a href="#anion">anions</a>.<p>

<a name="ionic_compound"><b><u>Ionic Compound</u></b> - a chemical substance
composed of <a href="#ion">ions</a>.  Despite being composed of ions, ionic
compounds do not have a net electrical charge.  Ions of opposite charges are
present in a ration such that their charges cancel.  The ration determines
the number of each ion in a <a href="#formula_unit">formula unit</a> and thus
the chemical formula of the compound.

<a name="O"><h3>O</h3>
<a name="oxidation"><b><u>Oxidation</u></b> - the process by which the 
<a href="#ox_num">oxidation number</a> of a species increases.  The 
oxidation number will increase when a species loses electrons.  For this 
reason, oxidation can be viewed as the process of losing electrons.<p>

<a name="ox_num"><b><u>Oxidation Number</u></b> - an index which
aids in keeping track of electrons.  An atom with an oxidation number less
than zero has in some sense gained electrons.  An atom with an oxidation 
number greater than zero has in some sense lost electrons.<p>

<a name="oxidizing_agent><b><u>Oxidizing Agent</b></u> - the species in a 
chemical reaction which causes oxidation to occur.  The oxidizing agent
always contains at least one atom which is reducing.<p>

<a name="P"><h3>P</h3>
<a name="proton"><b><u>Proton</u></b> - one of the three basic sub-atomic 
particles.  A protron has a mass aproximately 1800 times that of an electron
(1.672 648 6 x 10^-27 kg.)  A protron also carries a positive electrical 
charge (1.602 189 2 x 10^-19 C.)  Because the charge on the proton is 
equal in magnitude (but opposite in sign) to that on the electron, the 
relative charge on the proton is often used.  The relative charge on a 
proton is +1.<p>

<a name="R"><h3>R</h3>
<a name="reducing_agent"><b><u>Reducing Agent</u></b> - the species which
causes reduction to occur in a chemical reaction.  The reducing agent always
contains at least one atom which is oxidizing.<p>

<a name="reduction"><b><u>Reduction</u></b> - the process by which the 
<a href="#ox_num">oxidation number</a> of a species decreases.  The 
oxidation number will decrease when a species gains electrons.  For this 
reason, reduction can be viewed as the process of gaining electrons.<p>

<a name="S"><h3>S</h3>
<a name="spectator_ion"><b><u>Spectator Ion</u></b> - an ion which is 
unchanged in a chemical reaction.  Spectator ions are required in many
chemical reactions to balance the charges of ions which do participate
in the chemistry.<p>

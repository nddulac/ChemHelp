<h1>Oxidation Numbers</h1>
Consider a sodium ion (Na^+).  We know from the formula that the ion 
contains one fewer <a href="gloss.html#electron">electron</a> than the number 
of <a href="gloss.html#proton">protons</a>.  In essence the formula, or more
specifically the charge, tells us that one electron has "gone away" from
this atom.<p>

The index which indicates how many electrons a species has gained or lost
is the <a href="gloss.html#ox_num>oxidation number</a>.  Since 
<a href="neutral.html">neutral atoms</a> have the same number of electrons as 
protons, we assign them an oxidation number of zero.  Also, an 
<a href="neutral.html">element in an uncombined form</a> is given an oxidation 
number of zero.  The oxidation number of a <a href="monatnum.html">monatomic 
ion</a> is given by the charge of the ion.<p>

In polyatomic species, <a href="specials.html">some atoms always are given the 
same oxidation number</a>.  The charge on a <a href="polatnum.html">polyatomic 
ion</a> gives the sum of the oxidation numbers for each atom in the ion.  
Likewise, the sum of oxidation numbers in a <a href="polatnum.html#neutral">
polyatomic neutral compound</a> is zero (because the total charge on the 
compound is zero.)<p>

<a name="on2">
Whenever a species gains or loses an electron (or more than one electron)
the oxidation number of at least one atom in the species will change.  When
the oxidation number gets larger, the process is called 
<a href="gloss.html#oxidation">oxidation</a>.  When the oxidation number gets 
smaller, the process is called <a href="gloss.html#reduction">reduction</a>.
A reaction which involves oxidation and reduction is often refered to as a
<b>redox reaction</b>.<p>

<a name="on3>
When a species oxidizes, it gives up electrons.  That implies that some 
species must be taking those electrons.  The species that takes the electrons 
can be thought of as <i>causing the oxidation</i>.  The substance which takes
the electrons and thus causes oxidation is called the <b>oxidizing agent</b>.
It is interesting to note that because the oxidizing agent is gaining 
electrons, the oxidizing agent must always contain at least one atome which 
is reducing.  The species which is being oxidized can be thought of as 
<i>causing the oxidizing agent to reduce</i>.  Hence, the compound containing 
the element which is oxidizing is called the <b>reducing agent</b>.  
<a href="example2.html">Identifying the oxidizing and reducing agents</a> is 
an important skill toward understanding redox chemistry.<p>

<h1>Significant Digits in Calculations</h1>

Every measurement has an uncertainty.  When you give directions to your 
house, you might give distances with a certain amount of give and take.
For example, you might tell a person to turn "five miles after the 
stoplight."  Do you mean five miles plus or minus an inch?  Or maybe 
five miles plus or minus a quarter mile?<p>

In chemistry (like in most other fields!) we concern ourself with the
size of that plus/minus interval.  Just how big it is will determine 
how many significant digits there are in a result.<p>

For example, when someone writes <b>4.5332 g</b> they are implying that 
the number of grams is known to +/- 0.0001 gram.  If that mass were to 
be compared to another mass of say <b>43.23 g</b> (which as written is 
implied to be known to +/- 0.01 g) we would say that the uncertainty in
the second mass is larger than in the first.  So there would be no 
point in reporting the sum of the two masses to any smaller uncertainty
than +/- 0.01 g.  So claiming that the sum was <b>47.7632 g 
(+/- 0.01 g)</b> would be silly since the last two digits obviously 
have no meaning.  The correct way of reporting the sum would be to 
round the result to the correct uncertainty of +/- 0.01 g.<p>

Here is an example.<p>

  <tr>
    <td><b>Example</b>:</td>
    <td bgcolor="ffcc99">A beaker is weighed and found to have a mass
        of 78.45 g.  A sample of sodium chloride is added to the beaker
        and the beaker is weighed again using a different balance.  The 
        NaCl plus the beaker are found to have a mass of 79.6743 g.
        What is the mass of the sodium chloride?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Solution</b>:</td>
    <td bgcolor="ccff99">
      First, take the difference to get the mass of the sodium chloride:<p>

      <pre>
    79.7643 g         (mass of beaker and NaCl)
  - 78.45   g       - (mass of beaker         )
    ---------         -------------------------
     3.3143 g         (mass of            NaCl)
      </pre><p>
      Next, round to the correct number of significant digits:<p>
      <pre>

     3.3143 g  ==>   <b>3.31 g</b>
      </pre><p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2" bgcolor="ff9999"><i>Note</i>: We can retain only those decimal 
        places that the uncertainty allows.  In this case, +/- 0.01 g 
        for the mass of the beaker meant we needed to round to the 
        nearest hundredth of a gram.

            <p>Chemistry is the study of <b>matter</b> and how it transforms. In order to discuss matter, it is important to develop a language which we can use to discuss the topic. However, in order to describe samples of matter, letâ€™s first think about changes.</p>

            <p>Once we understand how to think about the transformations of matter, it is possible to consider how to classify samples of matter based on how the sample can be separated into simpler (or component) samples of matter.</p>
